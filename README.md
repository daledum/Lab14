# Lab14
Measurement of distance, using a slide potentiometer, written in C. 

This is lab 14 from the Edx hosted MOOC UTAustinX: UT.6.01x Embedded Systems - Shape the World.

This lab has these major objectives: 
1) an introduction to sampling analog signals using the ADC interface; 
2) the development of an ADC device driver; 
3) learning data conversion and calibration techniques; 
4) the use of fixed-point numbers, which are integers used to represent non-integer values; 
5) the development of an interrupt-driven real-time sampling device driver; 
6) the development of a software system involving multiple files; 
and 7) learn how to debug one module at a time.

Use SysTick interrupts to periodically initiate a software-triggered ADC conversion, convert the sample to a fixed-point decimal distance, and store the result in a mailbox.
The foreground thread takes the result from the mailbox, converts the result to a string, and prints it to the Nokia5110 LCD. The display is optional.
